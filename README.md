# 100 Days of Python

This repository is part of my personal journey to improve Python skills by completing multiple Python programs in journey of 100 days of learning python . Each script is stored as a separate `.py` file.
## Objective

To build discipline, consistency, and real coding experience by writing and committing Python programs for 100 days.

## Structure

- Each file is named `dayX.py`, where X is the day number.
- Programs vary from basic logic to intermediate-level problems (e.g., automation, games, web scraping, etc.).
- Code is commented for clarity.
